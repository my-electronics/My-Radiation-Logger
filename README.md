It uses the [My Plot](http://github.com/my-electronics/My-Plot) widget for plotting and has no dependencies on any external libaries.

The software can record CPM data in realtime, save logfiles as well as display logfiles from the SD card logger. My Radiation Logger has been tested on Windows, MacOS and Linux.
